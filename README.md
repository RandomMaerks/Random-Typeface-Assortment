# Random Font Assortment

**Random Font Assortment** is a collection of unfinished or unpublished typefaces made by me. Most typefaces here are created during my time (self-)studying type design.

## History

| Name | Creation date | Information |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Grotesquerie | 15/06/2021 | My very first typeface using FontForge! Also marks the proper beginning of my type design journey. |
| Contemporarity | 19/09/2021 | Inspired by Google's Product Sans, I tried to make my own version. Didn't work out as much, and I really tried to turn it into a product, even though I still have little to no experience with type design. |
| Connecto | 16/10/2021 | A funky experiment. |
| Edgecutting Lite | 12/11/2021 | My first attempt at geometric sans. Inspired by Tom Watkins & Ellen Luff's [Aventa](https://www.behance.net/gallery/95404013/Aventa-Variable-Typeface).
| hiContr | 17/12/2021 | My first attempt at... high contrast typeface! |
| Jygre | 05/03/2022 | An experiment with letterforms, but is still ordinary enough for most uses. |
| Utilik | 20/03/2022 | A bitmap? typeface. |
| Sundryent | 30/04/2022 | Inspired by Alex Slobzheninov's [Agrandir](https://pangrampangram.com/products/agrandir). |
| Edgecutting | 07/07/2022 | A revision of Edgecutting Lite. |
| Antique Grotesk | 26/07/2022 | An attempt at making those ugly af fonts. Not sure where I got inspired from, but it was inspired by something. |
| Grotv | 27/02/2023 | Meant to be a fully functional workhorse. I dropped it. |
